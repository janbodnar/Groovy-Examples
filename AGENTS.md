# Instructions


## The beginning of the document

The beginning of the document contains a lengthy introduction to the topic covered.  
If the document is about Groovy arrays, the beginning of the document must contain  
an in-depth description of arrays and necessary definitions.  

## Adding code descriptions 

When asked to add description, provide a brief description below the section  
and explain the code example in more details below the code.  Text should be  
max 80 chars per line, terminated with two spaces. If there are already some examples  
and the description is missing, add it.  

Be consistent with existing documents in the repository.

## Examples 

Each example builds on the previous one, progressing from simpler to more complex concepts.  
Do not number section titles for examples such as Example 1: Basic types, use only simple title such as  
Basic types. Follow Groovy best practices.
Do not use Hello Word messages in the examples, this is overused on the net. Use hello there when necessary.
